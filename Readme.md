This is a script which uses city level cost of living and purchasing power index information from Numbeo to calculate discretionary income estimates.
- It prints out the results and saves them into a csv.
- It contains tax rates from https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/personal-income-tax-rate. It is not entirely clear how to interpret these numbers.
- It also calculates years to achieve a particular financial goal (e.g. for retirement) in each city.

The calculations might need a big review especially against Numbeo's own methodology.
